# ECG_anomaly_detection


##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a **deep learning model** capable of **automatically detecting anomalies** in ECG (electrocardiogram) signals.  
These anomalies may indicate **heart problems** or other **underlying medical conditions**.

##  Context

This project explores how computers and artificial intelligence can help **understand how the human heart functions** by analyzing ECG signals.  
These signals represent the **heartbeat patterns** and are used to detect irregularities that may require medical attention.

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Deep Learning (Keras / TensorFlow or PyTorch)  
- Signal Processing  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
..
..
##  Dataset

The dataset consists of ECG signals collected for the purpose of anomaly detection.  
The data is preprocessed and formatted for a binary classification task (normal / abnormal).

##  Expected Outcome

A reliable model that can:
- Learn from examples of normal and abnormal ECG signals
- Automatically identify anomalies in unseen ECG data
- Assist healthcare professionals through **AI-based diagnostic support**
